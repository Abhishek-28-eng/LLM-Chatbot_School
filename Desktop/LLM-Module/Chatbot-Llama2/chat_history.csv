hii,"The stage of a womanâ€™s pregnancy can be determined through various methods, including:

1. Menstrual history: The doctor will ask questions about the woman's menstrual cycle to determine the stage of pregnancy.
2. Physical examination: The doctor will perform a physical examination to confirm the stage of pregnancy. This may be done at an office visit before the abortion or on the day of the abortion.
3. Ultrasound: An ultrasound can also be used to determine the stage of pregnancy. However, some states require a waiting period before an abortion can be performed using this method.

It is important to note that the doctor must accurately determine the stage of pregnancy before an abortion can be performed."

While the physical examination may provide some clues, it is important to have a complete picture of the woman's reproductive health in order to determine the best time for an abortion. The doctor will likely ask about the woman's last menstrual period and other details related to her menstrual cycle in order to make an informed decision about when to perform the abortion."
